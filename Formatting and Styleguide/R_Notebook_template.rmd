# Introduction

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. 
This is the format you should use to submit to the github.
Both the file you are currently edition (.rmd) and the HTML output (.HTML) should be uploaded.


## Introduction to Markdown

Markdown is a very common text editing format for the web.
You can find out more about markdown formatting and how to use it in R from the [R Markdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).
Here are some quick tips: 

- Headings are denoted by a pound sign (#) at the start of the line.
Multiple pound signs indicate sub headings. 
These headings will show up in the table of contents of the HTML file.
- A blank line is required to start a new paragraph.
Just hitting enter once will cause whatever you're writing to come after the previous line.
However it's good to put each sentence on it's own line for ease of readability in R studio (or another code editor).
It will just look like one paragraph on the HTML output.
- You can make text *italic* or **bold** by putting one or two asterisks respectively on either side of the text.
_ Links are made by putting the text you want to display within [] and the link in () right after.
For example [text to show on screen]_(link the text goes to) would create a link if you remove the underscore.

## Document setup

At the top of the document you can see a number of fields between three dashed lines.
These are the fields that tell the document how to be formatted when you convert it from R.
The title and output fields are required for every document, but you should always have the author and date fields as well.
For the date put the date the document was last updated (and add any updates to the changelog below).

By looking at the rmd file you can see that there are output types specified: an html_notebook and a html_document.
These are very similar, but they differ in how they are made and what data they display.
When you save a html notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it as a .nb.html file (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
Importantly, making a notebook does not run any code, it only shows the output of the code as is currently displayed in the R studio editor.

On the other hand, making a html documents runs every chunk of code.
This of course can take much longer, but it also means all of the output is displayed.
To make an html document you go to where it says preview (or knit) on the top of the editor screen and click "knit to html".
This will output a document with just the .html format.

In general, html notebooks are good for seeing what your document will look like as you write it, but html documents are better as the final product.
Only the .html and not .nb.html will display on the github page properly, so only upload that version.

### Document options

Underneath the output type there are a number of other option that change how the output will be rendered. 
Here are what some of them mean:

- toc: means table of contents, which makes a table out of all of your headers. 
If you add toc_float = yes it causes the table of contents to move with you as you scroll the document.
- theme: the appearance of the text and background of the document. 
The Journal theme looks very clean, but other themes are listed in the R markdown book.
- highlight: how code in code chunks should be highlighted.
The options are shown [here](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/blog/pandoc-syntax-highlighting-examples/).
It makes code more readable to pick one with noticeable differences between types of code. 

# Code Chunks

The big difference between an R markdown and regular markdown button is that you can insert code chunks and run them in the document.
Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.
In the dropdown menu you can add code chunks of other languages, like bash.
By default R studio will not be able to run these code chunks, but you can modify it to do so. 
However if you're writing a document with mixed types of code it's good to include the chunks, but turn off evaluation.

Here is an example of a code chunk:
```{r name of chunk}
#Having eval=FALSE in the header(put a comma after the chunk name first) means the code won't run when the document is knit. This is useful for writing dummy code for thse guides.
#You can change how the code is output otherwise using the options cog on the top right of the chunk.
plot(iris$Sepal.Length,iris$Sepal.Width) #You can write code in chunks and they will be outputed in the document in-line
```


When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. 
Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


# Changelog

Every document should include a changelog at the bottom.
For each time the document is changed, put a short description of what was changed, the date, and who changed it. 
This can be seen on github (using the blame feature), but the changelog is good for people not as familiar with github to see when it was last modified.
